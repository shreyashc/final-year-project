A Scheme for Promotion of Innovation, Rural Industries and Entrepreneurship (ASPIRE) is a Government of India initiative and promoted by the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME).</p>
        <p>The mentioned scheme was launched in 2015 to offer proper knowledge to the entrepreneurs to start with their business and emerge as employers.

The Ministry of Medium and Small Enterprises has tried to boost economic development at the grassroots level. The total budget of the scheme initially was INR 62.5 crores for the period of 2014-2016.</p>

        <p>To build reliance on non-conventional sources of power, the government of India has decided to set up 40,000 MWp of Grid-Interactive Rooftop Solar PV Plants in the next five years. These rooftop solar PV plants will be set up in residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional sectors in the country and shall range from 1 kWp to 500 kWp in terms of capacity. Such rooftop plants are economically viable since they can produce electricity using solar energy at about INR 7 per kWh without any subsidy. The government also provides a subsidy of 15% on these plants to the associations or individual companies, making the scheme even more lucrative.</p>
